  description: The Tyrannosaurus rex, commonly known as T-Rex, was a large carnivorous
    dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, approximately 68 to 66
    million years ago. It was one of the last dinosaur species to exist before the
    mass extinction event. T-Rex is characterized by its powerful hind limbs, tiny
    forelimbs, and large, robust skull with sharp teeth. It was a apex predator,
    likely preying on herbivorous dinosaurs of its time. With its massive size and
    fearsome appearance, T-Rex has become an iconic symbol of the dinosaur era and
    a popular subject in paleontological studies and popular culture.
