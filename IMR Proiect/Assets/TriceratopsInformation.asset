  description: 'The Triceratops was a large herbivorous dinosaur characterized by
    its distinctive frill adorned with three facial horns. It belonged to the ceratopsid
    family and lived during the Late Cretaceous period, around 68 to 66 million years
    ago. Triceratops was a quadrupedal dinosaur with a robust body, and it is one
    of the most well-known and recognizable dinosaurs.  During the Late Cretaceous,
    Triceratops roamed the ancient landscapes of North America, where it likely occupied
    a variety of environments ranging from forests to plains. The three facial horns,
    along with the frill, are believed to have served both defensive and possibly
    social functions. Triceratops shared its ecosystem with other iconic dinosaurs
    like Tyrannosaurus rex and had a significant impact on Late Cretaceous ecosystems.
    The discovery of numerous fossils has contributed to our understanding of this
    remarkable dinosaur from the Mesozoic era. '
