  description: The Pachycephalosaurus was a herbivorous dinosaur known for its distinctive
    thickened skull and dome-shaped head, which could be used for head-butting behaviors.
    This dinosaur lived during the Late Cretaceous period, approximately 75 to 65
    million years ago.  Pachycephalosaurus was a bipedal dinosaur with a relatively
    small body but a thick, bony skull roof. The purpose of its domed skull has been
    the subject of scientific debate, with hypotheses ranging from defensive displays
    to intraspecific combat during mating rituals.
