  description: 'The Brontosaurus, also known as Apatosaurus, was a massive, herbivorous
    dinosaur that lived during the Late Jurassic period, around 155 to 150 million
    years ago. It belonged to the sauropod family and is renowned for its long neck
    and tail, as well as its four sturdy legs. Brontosaurus was a colossal dinosaur,
    reaching lengths of up to 75 feet (23 meters) or more.  Historical data suggests
    that Brontosaurus led a herbivorous lifestyle, primarily feeding on vegetation.
    Its long neck allowed it to reach high foliage in trees, while its powerful tail
    likely served for balance. The discovery of fossils and skeletal remains has
    provided valuable insights into the anatomy and behavior of this majestic dinosaur.
    Despite past controversies regarding its classification, Brontosaurus remains
    a fascinating and iconic dinosaur in the field of paleontology. '
