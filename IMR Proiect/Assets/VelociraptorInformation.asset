  description: The Velociraptor was a small, agile, and intelligent carnivorous dinosaur
    with a distinctive sickle-shaped retractable claw on each hind foot. Velociraptor
    lived during the Late Cretaceous period, approximately 85 to 70 million years
    ago.  These dinosaurs were about the size of a turkey and had a sleek, feathered
    appearance. Contrary to popular depictions, Velociraptors likely had feathers,
    emphasizing their connection to modern birds. Velociraptors were believed to
    be swift and highly predatory, using their sharp teeth and claws for hunting
    smaller prey.
