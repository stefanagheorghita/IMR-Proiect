  description: The Stegosaurus was a distinctive herbivorous dinosaur known for its
    unique double row of large, bony plates along its back and the array of spikes
    on its tail. This dinosaur lived during the Late Jurassic period, approximately
    155 to 150 million years ago.  Stegosaurus had a relatively small head, a heavily
    built body, and walked on four sturdy legs. Its distinctive plates, which were
    not directly attached to its skeleton but likely embedded in its skin, may have
    functioned as a form of temperature regulation or played a role in display and
    communication.
